## **Features**
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outliers, and scaling features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing weather trends and understanding data patterns.
- **Model Training:** Implementing various ML models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Model Evaluation:** Measuring model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² Score.
- **Prediction:** Forecasting future weather conditions.

## **Model Training**
1. The data is split into training and testing sets.
2. Several machine learning models are trained and compared to find the best-performing model.
3. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance.

## **Results**
- The best model achieved an RMSE of X on the test set.
- The model can accurately predict temperature, humidity, and other weather parameters within acceptable error margins.

## **Future Work**
- Integrate real-time weather data for continuous model updates.
- Explore deep learning techniques for improved accuracy.
- Add support for more weather parameters like air quality and visibility.
